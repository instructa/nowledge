# Getting Started with Vector Search

This guide will help you get started with the vector search functionality.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies
2. Setup the database
3. Ingest your documents

## Basic Usage

The system provides two main tools:
- `markdown_ingest`: For adding documents to the vector database
- `markdown_search`: For searching through your documents using semantic similarity

## Example Workflow

1. First, ingest your markdown documents
2. Then search using natural language queries
3. Get relevant results based on semantic similarity

The vector search uses embeddings to understand the meaning of your content, not just keyword matching.
